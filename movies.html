                This section is dedicated to the movies that have shapped me, or movies that I simply enjoy a lot. 
                From the moment I watched them for the first time, these movies have been stuck in my brain and have 
                helped me understand me and the world better

                    <p class="card-description">
                        First in the list is a movie that has shaped how I see relationships and even how I react to 
                        change. 500 Days of Summer is a real story about love and how sometimes people are just not fit for one another, 
                        even if doesn't feel like that. This movie has thought me that sometimes to move on and let go if far better that 
                        reminisce in the past.

                    <h2 class="card-title">Spider-Man 2</h2>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        Where to even start with this one. Spider-Man 2 has shaped the very person I am today. This is the real feeling 
                        of adult responsibilities piling up on someone, feeling trapped in a cycle that never seems to end, but even dispite 
                        all that, you still do the right thing, you stay strong and true to yourself. I have loved this movie since I was
                        2 years old and every now and then I revisit just to remember to be strong.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        Fall Guy is just a funny romantic commedy. The camera work, script, and acting is on point and the 
                        is so fun to follow. This is more heartfelt and comforting for me. Definitely a fun time every time I rewatch, I would 
                        recommend it for a movie night.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        This is another movie that has tought me so much. Into the Spider-Verse is such a beautiful sight to see, and hear. From 
                        the gorgeous animation and visual effects, to the harmonic original soundtrack, everything about this movie was so perfectly 
                        crafted, and this is without talking about its message. This movie tought me that things are scary, not because we can't do 
                        them, but because they are new and it just takes a leap of faith.

                    <h2 class="card-title">Whiplash</h2>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        Whiplash is such a passionate movie. This is a movie about how far would you go to be the best in something you 
                        love. The story of Andrew and Fletcher and how they clash and how each one brings a fire in the other and the 
                        lenghts they go to push each other. Whiplash is about passion for the art. In addition to that, even the way this movie 
                        came to be is really a passion project.
