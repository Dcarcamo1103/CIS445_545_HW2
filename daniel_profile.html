            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I am a <a href="https://www.bradley.edu" id="link" target="_blank">Bradley University</a> 
                student. I major in Computer Information Systems and I have a minor in User 
                Experience Design. I really enjoy web design and I hope to build my 
                career around that.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I love movies, specially sci-fi and comic book media, photography, 
                and reading comics. In addition to that, I really enjoy staying active, 
                like going to the gym and biking from time to time. 
            </p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I'm someone who has grown into loving the outside and staying active quite much, at least as much as 
                possible. I love going to the gym and biking. I'm also someone who enjoys movies, specially sci-fi and 
                superhero ones, this is why being part of the film club is right up my alley. In addition to that, I've 
                gotten the chance to pick photography as a hobbie, and I must say is quite a relaxing one, at least for 
                me.
